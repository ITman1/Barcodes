                             BARCODES LIBRARY
================================================================================

Barcodes library is library that provides interface for detection of the 
barcodes and their subsequent decoding written in C++ using OpenCV library.

Detection support: QR code model 2
Decoding support: QR code model 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           BUILDING THE LIBRARY

REQUIREMENTS:

1) Have compiled OpenCV library.
   See: http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/
2) Have customized variables OPENCV_INSTALL_DIR, OPENCV_INCLUDE_PATH and
   OPENCV_LIB_PATH (at the top of the Makefile)

BUILDING:
1) Run GNU Make inside this directory, library will be compiled into lib directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           USING THE LIBRARY

REQUIREMENTS:

1) Have in the search PATH the shared libraries of the OpenCV and compiled 
   shared library of the Barcodes Library.
2) Have generated include header files of the Barcodes Library (inside include
   directory). That can be done with GNU Make inside this directory:
       make gen-include
3) For compiling include header files of this library and OpenCV library and 
   for building executable/library link Barcodes Library and all libraries of 
   the OpenCV.

EXAMPLE OF USING LIBRARY
    #include <barlib/barcodes/qr/QrBarcode.h>
    using namespace barcodes;

    Image image = Image::fromFileGrayscale("test.jpg");
    QrBarcode::detect(image, detectedMarks);
